GRATF 2.0.1 release notes
------------------------------
06.03.2012.

Version updates and fixes:

* The project is updated to use AForge.NET framework version 2.2.4.1.

* The project is updated to use Visual Studion .NET 2010 (C# Express Edition 2010 is fine to use).

* The project is updated to use XNA 4.0.




GRATF 2.0.0 release notes
------------------------------
19.09.2011.

Version updates and fixes:

* The project is updated to use AForge.NET framework version 2.2.2

* Glyph recognition/tracking library
  - Added glyph tracking class, which tracks glyphs throughout a video stream.
    While tracking it takes care of glyphs' "shaking" - suppresses noise in
    detection of glyphs' corners (if any of corners' coordinates don't change
    for more than one pixel, then corners' coordinates are taken from previous
    video frame). Also the class does glyphs' pose estimation using Coplanar
    POSIT algorithm from AForge.Math namespace.

* Glyph Recognition Studio
  - Added possibility to print glyphs from the application.
  
  - Added XNA based visualizer of 3D augmented reality. It puts 3D object on top
    of a recognized glyph using same pose as the glyph has.




GRATF 1.0.0 release notes
------------------------------
05.11.2010.

First release of the project. Based on AForge.NET framework v.2.1.4

It includes:

- A prototype of glyph recognition algorithm, which is implemented as a
  plug-in to IPPrototyper tool from AForge.NET framework. Can be used
  for demonstrating glyph recognition algorithm's idea step by step or
  for its further improvement, debugging and testing.
  
- Glyph Recognition Studio - an application which does recognition of glyphs
  in video streams (video files or local capture devices, like web cameras).
  Also the application does 2D augmented reality - puts images into video
  feed replacing recognized glyphs - virtual objects in real world.

- Glyph recognition library, which is an extension to AForge.NET framework.
  The library can be reused in other applications which require glyph
  recognition functionality.
